# Partner Center Bot
This is a sample project that demonstrates how to leverage the Microsoft Bot framework to construct a bot that interacts with Partner Center. With this initial release limited
features are supported. Additional abilities will be added over time. The intent of this project is not to provide a fully functional bot, but rather to demonstrate how this 
technology can be utilize to support customers. Most customers want the ability to resolve issues on their own, and this sample provides you a tool that can help fufill that
desire.

This project is being provided with community support only. If you need help please

In addition to integrating with Partner Center the bot integrates with the [QnA Maker](docs/QnAMaker.md) cognitive service.
This makes it where the user can get answers to commonly asked questions.
